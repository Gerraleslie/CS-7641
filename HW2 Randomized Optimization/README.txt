1. In this assignment, I have used ipython notebooks, each problem is another indepenedent notebook to make it easier to run.
2. For Neural Network problems, all algorithms are different files and can be run independently. 
2. I used matplotlib for plotting. I alse used mlrose-hiive, sklearn library and some other libraries. 
3. all the resources can be downloaded by this command: 

git clone https://github.com/Gerraleslie/CS-7641.git

4. There are pickle objects that can be read using the second sell for problem notebooks. They can be used to get the result dataframes instead of running them again.
5. Thanks.
