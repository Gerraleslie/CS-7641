1. In this assignment, I have used ipython notebooks, each problem is another indepenedent notebook to make it easier to run.
2. For Neural Network problems, all algorithms are different files and can be run independently. 
2. mlrose-hiive, sklearn library along with some basic Python data transformation libraries are used with matplotlib for plotting.
3. The dataset is not very large so I have put them in the same folder with the notebooks. The notebooks and datasets can be downloaded using this git command:

git clone https://github.com/Gerraleslie/CS-7641.git

4. To run any problem or neural network optimization, please open the corresponding notebook and run all cells in order (Run All can be done on Run tab). 
5. There are pickle objects that can be read using the second sell for problem notebooks. They can be used to get the result dataframes instead of running them again.
6. Thanks.
